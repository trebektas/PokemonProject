          The Pokémon franchise began as Pocket Monsters: Red and Green (later
          released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue), a pair of video
          games for the original Game Boy handheld system that were developed by
          Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996. Pokémon soon
          became a media mix franchise adapted into various different media,
          with the Pokémon Trading Card Game released in October 1996, the
          Pokémon Adventures manga first released in Japan in March 1997, and
          the Pocket Monsters: Original Series released in April 1997. Pocket
          Pikachu was released in Japan in March 1998, with the July 18: with
          the first ever Pokémon movie, Pokémon The First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes
          Back, first released in Japan in July 1998. In 1998, Nintendo spent
          $25 million promoting Pokémon in the United States in partnership with
          Hasbro, KFC, and others. Nintendo initially feared that Pokémon was
          too Japanese for Western tastes but Alfred Kahn, then CEO of 4Kids
          Entertainment convinced the company otherwise. The one who spotted
          Pokémon's potential in the United States was Kahn's colleague Thomas
          Kenney. In November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which had managed the
          non-game related licensing of Pokémon, announced that it had agreed
          not to renew the Pokémon representation agreement. The Pokémon Company
          International oversees all Pokémon licensing outside Asia. In 2006,
          the franchise celebrated its tenth anniversary with the release of
          Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. In 2016, the Pokémon Company celebrated
          Pokémon's 20th anniversary by airing an ad during Super Bowl 50 in
          January and re-releasing the first Pokémon video games 1996 Game Boy
          games Pokémon Red, Green (only in Japan), and Blue, and the 1998 Game
          Boy Color game Pokémon Yellow for the Nintendo 3DS on February 26,
          2016. The mobile augmented reality game Pokémon Go was released in
          July 2016. Pokémon Sun and Moon also released in the same year. The
          first live-action film in the franchise, Pokémon Detective Pikachu,
          based on the 2018 Nintendo 3DS spin-off game Detective Pikachu, was
          released in 2019. The eighth generation of core series games began
          with Pokémon Sword and Shield, released worldwide on the Nintendo
          Switch on November 15, 2019. To celebrate its 25th anniversary, the
          company released two additional titles for the Nintendo Switch:
          Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, remakes of the Nintendo
          DS Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games, on November 19, 2021, and its
          "premake" Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which was subsequently released on
