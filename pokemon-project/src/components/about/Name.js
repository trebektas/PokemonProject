        The name "Pokémon" is a syllabic abbreviation of the Japanese brand
        Pocket Monsters. The term "Pokémon", in addition to referring to the
        Pokémon franchise itself, also collectively refers to the many fictional
        species that have made appearances in Pokémon media. "Pokémon" is
        identical in the singular and plural, as is each individual species
        name; it is and would be grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and
        "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".
