      <h4>Gameplay</h4>
      <p>
        Pokémon executive director Satoshi Tajiri first thought of Pokémon,
        albeit with a different concept and name, around 1989, when the Game Boy
        was released. The concept of the Pokémon universe, in both the video
        games and the general fictional world of Pokémon, stems from the hobby
        of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Tajiri enjoyed as a child.
        Players are designated as Pokémon Trainers and have three general goals:
        to complete the regional Pokédex by collecting all of the available
        Pokémon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place,
        to complete the national Pokédex by transferring Pokémon from other
        regions, and to train a team of powerful Pokémon from those they have
        caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers so they may
        eventually win the Pokémon League and become the regional Champion.
        These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost
        every version of the Pokémon franchise, including the video games, the
        anime and manga series, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game (also known as
        TCG). In most incarnations of the Pokémon universe, a Trainer who
        encounters a wild Pokémon has the ability to capture that Pokémon by
        throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a
        Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the
        Poké Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer.
        Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new
        Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that
        the Pokémon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out
        any of their Pokémon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokémon;
        if the opposing Pokémon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokémon
        with a Poké Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. In Pokémon
        Go, and in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, wild
        Pokémon encountered by players can be caught in Poké Balls, but most
        cannot be battled. Pokémon already owned by other Trainers cannot be
        captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a
        Pokémon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is
        knocked out ("faints"), the winning Pokémon gains experience points and
        may level up. Beginning with Pokémon X and Y, experience points are also
        gained from catching Pokémon in Poké Balls. When leveling up, the
        Pokémon's battling aptitude statistics ("stats", such as "Attack" and
        "Speed") increase. At certain levels, the Pokémon may also learn new
        moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of
        Pokémon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar
        but stronger species of Pokémon, a process called evolution; this
        process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is
        itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pokémon may
        undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may
        undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the
        Pokémon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into
        Raichu, following which no further evolutions may occur. Pokémon X and Y
        introduced the concept of "Mega Evolution," by which certain fully
        evolved Pokémon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a
        stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered
        a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible. In
        the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to
        raise a team of Pokémon to defeat many non-player character (NPC)
        Trainers and their Pokémon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path
        through a specific region of the Pokémon world for the Trainer to
        journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way
        (including foiling the plans of an evil team of Pokémon Trainers who
        serve as antagonists to the player). Excluding Pokémon Sun and Moon and
        Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, the games feature eight powerful
        Trainers, referred to as Gym Leaders, that the Trainer must defeat in
        order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and
        once all eight badges are collected, the Trainer is eligible to
        challenge the region's Pokémon League, where four talented trainers
        (referred to collectively as the "Elite Four") challenge the Trainer to
        four Pokémon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this
        gauntlet, they must challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer
        who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this
        last battle becomes the new champion.

      <h4>Pokémon universe</h4>
      <p>
        Pokémon is set in the fictional Pokémon universe. There are numerous
        regions that have appeared in the various media of the Pokémon
        franchise. There are 9 main series regions set in the main series games:
        Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh/Hisui, Unova, Kalos, Alola, Galar, and
        Paldea. Each of the nine generations of the main series releases focuses
        on a new region. Every region consists of several cities and towns that
        the player must explore in order to overcome many waiting challenges,
        such as Gyms, Contests and villainous teams. At different locations
        within each region, the player can find different types of Pokémon, as
        well as helpful items and characters. Different regions are not
        accessible from one another at all within a single game, only with the
        exception of Kanto and Johto being linked together in Pokémon Gold,
        Silver, Crystal, HeartGold and SoulSilver versions. There are also
        regions set in spinoff games and two islands in the Pokémon anime
        (Orange Islands and Decolore Islands), all still set within the same
        fictional universe. Each main series region in the Pokémon universe is
        based on a real world location. The first four regions introduced are
        based on locations in Japan, being Kantō, Kansai, Kyushu, and Hokkaidō,
        with later regions being based on parts on New York City, France,
        Hawaii, the United Kingdom, and the Iberian Peninsula.
